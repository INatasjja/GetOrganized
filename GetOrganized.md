# Requirements  

### Identified Business Problems  
- Employee onboarding must be reduced from 3 months.  
- New client onboarding is confusing and inconsistent.  
- Process are not standardized (each employee does things differently).  

### Functional Requirements  
-	Definition of an employee standardized onboarding process.
-	Definition of a customer standardized onboarding process.
-	Clear instructions and documentation for employees.
-	A system to keep track of the onboarding process.
-	The system must be able to generate a profile per customer so they can enroll as many pets as needed.
-	The system must allow the employees to update their information adding any service provided to its specific care (trims, baths)
 

### Non-Functional Requirements  
-	Consistent process across all staff.
-	Scalable to handle future growth.
-	User friendly and intuitive interface.
-	Secure handling of personal and pet-related information.
-	Responsive to different devices.

### Assumptions  
-	The Petcare has not a specific process for customers onboarding
-	All the processes are made manually
-	The owners are willing to invest in standardization and digital tools.
-	The employees have access to computers or tablets while at the pet care facilities.

### Follow up questions:
-	Do you have an existing manual or guide for the onboarding process?
-	Are there any internal policies about pet care or client handling?
-	Do you have a computer in the lobby area?
-	Should an integration with existing systems (payroll, schedules) be consider?
-	Do you sell any product, should we add a module to keep inventory and manage sales?
